# MovieHelper
Basic python script to reformat movie titles. Might add more functionality in the future. 

To Use:
1. Place the Python script and the attached files into your movie folder
2. Run the python script
3. When it finishes, read through the list. If something looks wonky double check it, this is a hastily made program. 
4. Assuming nothing went wrong, type Y into the console input, (it's case sensitive). 
5. Your movie library should now be looking sharp!
